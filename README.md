# Funkcja kwadratowa (Quadratic function)
TL;DR: **Please, don't use this code! For your own sanity.**

This 'application' was made for a school project using vanilla JavaScript. Hence comes its terrible quality and vulnerability.  
It was uploaded on GitHub only for its free hosting service, GitHub Pages.  
If you ever think of using this code in your own project, you'd better end up creating it by yourself. It would be much clearer and more secure.  
Also, even though the code was written entirely in English, the GUI is made in Polish.
